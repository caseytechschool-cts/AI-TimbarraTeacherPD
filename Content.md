# Artificial Intelligence

Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems capable of performing complex tasks that historically only a human could do, such as reasoning, making decisions, or solving problems.

However, decades before the current definition, the birth of artificial intelligence conversation was marked by Alan Turing's groundbreaking work, ["Computing Machinery and Intelligence"](https://redirect.cs.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf), published in 1950. In this paper, Turing, often referred to as the "father of computer science", poses a question: "Can machines think?" He then proposes a test, now famously known as the "Turing Test". This test involves an interrogator attempting to differentiate between a human and a machine's text response. Although this test has faced much criticism since its publication, it remains an essential part of AI history and continues to be a topic within philosophy due to its focus on linguistics.

Today, more than 70 years after Turing’s proposal, no AI has managed to successfully pass the test by fulfilling the specific conditions he outlined. Nonetheless, as some headlines reflect, a few systems have come quite close.
